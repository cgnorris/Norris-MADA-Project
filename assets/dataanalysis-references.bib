               houtenae, also known as subspecies I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and
               VI, respectively [1]. Members of Salmonella enterica subspecies
               enterica are mainly associated with warm-blooded vertebrates and
               are usually transmitted by ingestion of food or water
               contaminated by infected faeces. The pathogenicity of most of
               the distinct serotypes remains undefined, and even within the
               most common serotypes, many questions remain to be answered
               regarding the interactions between the organism and the infected
               host.Salmonellosis manifests itself in three major forms:
               enteritis, septicaemia, and abortion, each of which may be
               present singly or in combination, depending on both the serotype
               and the host involved. Although currently over 2300 serovars of
               Salmonella are recognized, only about 50 serotypes are isolated
               in any significant numbers as human or animal pathogens [2, 3]
               and they all belong to subspecies enterica. Of these, most cause
               acute gastroenteritis characterized by a short incubation period
               and a severe systemic disease in man or animals, characterized
               by septicaemia, fever and/or abortion, and such serotypes are
               often associated with one or few host species [4--6].It is the
               intention of this review to present a summary of current
               knowledge of these host-adapted serotypes of S. enterica. The
               taxonomic relationships between the serotypes will be discussed
               together with a comparison of the pathology and pathogenesis of
               the disease that they cause in their natural host(s). Since much
               of our knowledge on salmonellosis is based on the results of
               work on Typhimurium, this serotype will often be used as the
               baseline in discussion. It is hoped that an appreciation of the
               differences that exist in the way these serotypes interact with

               bacterial cause of foodborne illness in the United States, with
               well-established detection methodology. Current surveillance
               protocols rely on the characterization of a few colonies to
               represent an entire sample; thus, minority serovars remain
               undetected. Salmonella contains two CRISPR loci, CRISPR1 and
               CRISPR2, and the spacer contents of these can be considered
               serovar specific. We exploited this property to develop an
               amplicon-based and multiplexed sequencing approach,
               CRISPR-SeroSeq (serotyping by sequencing of the CRISPR loci), to
               identify multiple serovars present in a single sample. Using
               mixed genomic DNA from two Salmonella serovars, we were able to
               confidently detect a serovar that constituted 0.01\% of the
               sample. Poultry is a major reservoir of Salmonella spp.,
               including serovars that are frequently associated with human
               illness, as well as those that are not. Numerous studies have
               examined the prevalence and diversity of Salmonella spp. in
               poultry, though these studies were limited to culture-based
               approaches and therefore only identified abundant serovars.
               CRISPR-SeroSeq was used to investigate samples from broiler
               houses and a processing facility. Ninety-one percent of samples
               harbored multiple serovars, and there was one sample in which
               four different serovars were detected. In another sample, reads
               for the minority serovar comprised 0.003\% of the total number
               of Salmonella spacer reads. The most abundant serovars
               identified were Salmonella enterica serovars Montevideo,
               Kentucky, Enteritidis, and Typhimurium. CRISPR-SeroSeq also
               differentiated between multiple strains of some serovars. This
               high resolution of serovar populations has the potential to be
               utilized as a powerful tool in the surveillance of Salmonella
               species.IMPORTANCESalmonella enterica is the leading bacterial
               cause of foodborne illness in the United States and is

               serovars are pathogenic in humans, while others are not. Current
               surveillance for this pathogen is limited by the detection of
               only the most abundant serovars, due to the culture-based
               approaches that are used. Thus, pathogenic serovars that are
               present in a minority remain undetected. By exploiting
               serovar-specific differences in the CRISPR arrays of Salmonella
               spp., we have developed a high-throughput sequencing tool to be
               able to identify multiple serovars in a single sample and tested
               this in multiple poultry samples. This novel approach allows
               differences in the dynamics of individual Salmonella serovars to
               be measured and can have a significant impact on understanding
               the ecology of this pathogen with respect to zoonotic risk and
               public health.",
